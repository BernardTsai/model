Documentation
=============

This documentation is intended for administrators and developers who intend to evaluate,
use and enhance the orchestrator to manage the lifecycle of the virtual
infrastructure and software artifacts of a virtualized network function (VNF).

The orchestrator acts as a controller providing a set of
[functions](functions.md) which make use of a [VNF Model](vnf_model.md) to
define the desired state of a virtualized network function.

The [architecture](architecture.md) of the orchestrator consists of a set of
components which allow to maintain the required software artifacts in repositories,
monitor the current state of a virtualized network function and
modify specific entities of a VNF as needed.
